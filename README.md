# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview
With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, I received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization. 

## Results
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing
* The IS_SUCCESSFUL variable was the target for the model. It denotes whether an organizaion was trustworthy to fund. 

* The variables below are considered to be the features for the model.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary: 
The deep learning model yielded 78% accuracy after 3 iterations. The inital accuracy percentage was 72, and the next two attemps yielded 73% accuracy and 


Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
