# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview
With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, I received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization. 

## Results
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary: 
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
